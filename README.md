Repo for code to citecheck documents.

Extract propositions and cites, then create links to google scholar pages, and make html e.g.:

"{proposition}":  
cite 1 (link to that page on Scholar)  
cite 2 (…)  
{signal} cite 3 (…)

# Google Cite Link Form:

https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=537+U.S.+186&hl=en&as_sdt=2&btnI=1#p198

as_sdt=2 refers to cases rather than journal articles.

Works also for unpublished cases (as long as the opinion is the first result—I=1 refers to the first result):
